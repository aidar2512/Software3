 Redesign of the Computer Science Department Website | Ala-Too International University
 Project Description

This project represents a redesign of the official Computer Science Department website (CS AIU).
The main goal is to update the visual style of the pages, improve navigation usability, and adapt the interface to a modern design stack â€” while preserving the structure and content of the original site.

The redesign covers key sections of the website, including:

Home â€” the departmentâ€™s main landing page;

Department / News â€” a section with department news and events (including Career Day);

Software â€” a page showcasing software projects of the department;

other supporting pages that share the unified CSS stack.

 Main Objectives

Migrate the layout to a unified CSS stack, including colors.css, text.css, ui.css, and individual page-CSS files (e.g., news.css);

Improve visual perception using a grid-based structure and modern UI patterns;

Enhance text readability and contrast;

Adapt the design for different screen sizes (desktop and tablet);

Organize commits meaningfully and structure the repository for educational use.

 Technologies

The project is built using a classic front-end stack:

HTML5

CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Modern UI stack)

960 Grid System

Custom CSS files:

colors.css

text.css

ui.css

home.css, news.css, modern.css, etc.

The project maintains the original page structure but improves the overall appearance, optimizes styles, and allows for future scalability.
